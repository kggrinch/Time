# Time - For source code refer to Source branch

This project demonstrates a Timespan library in C++ designed to handle time computations and operations. It provides a management system to organize time given through hours, minutes, and seconds. Seconds and minutes are organized between -60 and 60 when stored, meaning that a user can create a Timespan object of 90 seconds, and the object will store it as 1 minute, 30 seconds. Additionally, the project includes comprehensive unit test cases in the main driver class, testing the correctness and robustness of the project.
